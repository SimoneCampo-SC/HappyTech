# HappyTech

# Definition of Aims
The project aims to create a software application for HappyTech that allows an employee to quickly generate feedback for an applicant in a specific format based on their type of application (e.g. CV or interview). 
The feedback should automatically generate when a code is selected so that the recruiter does not need to type a lot. After this, the feedback should be emailed to the applicant.

# Systems Requirements
1.	PC running Windows 7 operating system or later versions to prevent incompatibility;
2.	A Keyboard to write the template and interact with the application;
3.	A Mouse or Trackpad to interact with the Graphical User Interface;
4.	An internet connection to send the feedback to the applicants;
